FoxWorks Editor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application is supposed to be used for creating and editing EVDS/IVSS data
files for the FoxWorks Aerospace Simulator or any compatible applications.

The entire editor must be rewritten using GLC_lib and a slightly different approach
to how things are handled. There's no way to extend it before that's done.
